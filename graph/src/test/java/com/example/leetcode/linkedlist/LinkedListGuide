1. Recursion or iteration
2. Two Linked list
   > merge sort logic

3. use map to memorize node as there is no index to locate node at O(1)
    >copy list with random pointer
    >clone map

3. Find length of linked list
   >fast and slow pointer technique: both fast and slow starts at head
           ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
           while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
               slow = slow.next;
               fast = fast.next.next;
               if (slow == fast) return true;//check after move both pointers
           }

4. cut the linked list into half and half
        //length can be 2
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            pre = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        //length>=3
        while(p2.next!=null&&p2.next.next!=null){
            p1=p1.next;
            p2=p2.next.next;
        }

        ListNode start=p1.next;
        p1.next=null;

5. remove node from list, use dummy head to avoid 1 node edge case
6. If modification on linked list, remember to disconnect nodes
